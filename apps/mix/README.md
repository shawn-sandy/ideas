# Atomix `(beta)`

A SASS toolkit for generating CSS utility classes and components from 
**Design Tokens**.

## Install

- **Install Atomix(beta)**

```

npm i -D @shawnsandy/mix

```

- **Install Style Dictionary**

> Style Dictionary is a build system that allows you to define styles once, in a way for any platform or language to consume. A single place to create and edit your styles, and a single command exports these rules to all the places you need them - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, or anything you can think of. It is available as a CLI through npm, but can also be used like any normal node module if you want to extend its functionality.

```

// global
npm i -g style-dictionary

```

**Uility classes** (example)

1. Create/Import your tokens [(creating tokens)](#creating-tokens)
2. Config Atomix using SASS defaults
3. Import Atomix
4. Include the utility mixin and run you build
5. View [UTILITY TOKENS]('./dist/color.css') example

```scss

/** Import tokens, replace the import file below with your own **/
@import "node_modules/@shawnsandy/mix/tokens/tokens";

/** Config Atomix SASS defaults */

$mix-tokens: $tokens; // token variable name
$mix-namespace: "ui"; // namespace
$mix-base: "base"; // default utility name
$mix-colors: "color"; // color key
$mix-fonts: "fonts"; // font key
$mix-spacing: "spacing"; // padding and margin
$mix-sizing: "sizing"; //  width heights
$mix-prefix: "-"; // separator for you class names my-class-name
$mix-components: "components"; // default component key
$mix-modifier-states: active focus focus-within hover visited; // define the states that you use
$mix-color-attrs: "color", "background-color", "border-color";

/** import Atomix **/
@import "node_modules/@shawnsandy/mix/index";

/** utility mixin example--create font utility form our tokens **/
.ui {
  @include mix-utilities("font");
}

```


#### Creating Design Tokens


*The workflow below is not mandatory but strongly recommend*, Atomix really only needs a SASS-MAPS to do it's thing can write SASS-MAPS on your own, thats entirely up to you, once you stick to the map format(s).

*What are design tokens?*

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development. [Token Guide](./tokens.md)


- If you haven't yet install the Style Dictionary : [Style Dictionary Quick Start](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/quick_start)
- Create a `token.js` config file
- Write your tokens be sure to read about how to [format tokens for Atomix](./tokens.md#token-formats)
- Run style-dictionary

```js
// config file tokens.js
const config = require("@shawnsandy/mix/config/tokens.js");

module.exports = config({
  source: "tokens/**/*", // tokens dir--/tokens/my-tokens.json
  build: "scss/_tokens/", // build dir trailing slash required--scss/_tokens.scss
  name: "token/", // name of you scss token output file--tokens.scss
});
```

#### Run the build script

- Command line

```
style-dictionary build --config ./tokens.js

```

- NPM scripts

```
 "scripts": {
    "tokens": "style-dictionary build --config ./tokens.js"
  },
```

Run the scripts

```

npm run tokens

```
