# Atomix `(beta)`

A SASS toolkit for generating CSS utility classes and components from 
**Design Tokens**.

## Install

- **Install Atomix(beta)**

```

npm i -D @shawnsandy/mix

```

- **Install Style Dictionary**

> Style Dictionary is a build system that allows you to define styles once, in a way for any platform or language to consume. A single place to create and edit your styles, and a single command exports these rules to all the places you need them - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, or anything you can think of. It is available as a CLI through npm, but can also be used like any normal node module if you want to extend its functionality.

```

// global
npm i -g style-dictionary

```

**Uility classes** (example)

1. Create/Import your tokens [(creating tokens)](#creating-tokens)
2. Config Atomix using SASS defaults
3. Import Atomix
4. Include the utility mixin and run you build
5. View [UTILITY TOKENS]('./dist/color.css') example

```scss

/** Import tokens, replace the import file below with your own **/
@import "node_modules/@shawnsandy/mix/tokens/tokens";

/** Config Atomix SASS defaults */

$mix-tokens: $tokens; // token variable name
$mix-namespace: "ui"; // namespace
$mix-base: "base"; // default utility name
$mix-colors: "color"; // color key
$mix-fonts: "fonts"; // font key
$mix-spacing: "spacing"; // padding and margin
$mix-sizing: "sizing"; //  width heights
$mix-prefix: "-"; // separator for you class names my-class-name
$mix-components: "components"; // default component key
$mix-modifier-states: active focus focus-within hover visited; // define the states that you use
$mix-color-attrs: "color", "background-color", "border-color";

/** import Atomix **/
@import "node_modules/@shawnsandy/mix/index";

/** utility mixin example--create font utility form our tokens **/
.ui {
  @include mix-utilities("font");
}

```

### Design Tokens

**What are design tokens?**

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

### What are SASS Maps

> Maps in Sass hold pairs of keys and values, and make it easy to look up a value by its corresponding key. They’re written ( `<expression>: <expression>, <expression>: <expression>` ). The expression before the : is the key, and the expression after is the value associated with that key. The keys must be unique, but the values may be duplicated. Unlike lists, maps must be written with parentheses around them. A map with no pairs is written ().

#### Creating Tokens

Atomix really only needs a SASS-MAPS to do it's thing, and you can write SASS-MAPS on your own, thats entirely up to you, once you stick to the map format(s). The workflow below is not mandatory but strongly recommend.

- If you haven't yet install the Style Dictionary : [Style Dictionary Quick Start](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/quick_start)
- Create a token config file
- Write your tokens be sure to read about how to [format tokens for Atomix](#token-formats)
- Run style-dictionary

```js
// tokens.js
const config = require("@shawnsandy/mix/config/tokens");

module.exports = config({
  source: "tokens/**/*", // tokens dir--/tokens/my-tokens.json
  build: "scss/_tokens/", // build dir trailing slash required--scss/_tokens.scss
  name: "token/", // name of you scss token output file--tokens.scss
});
```

#### Run the build script

- Command line

```
style-dictionary build --config ./tokens.js

```

- NPM scripts

```
 "scripts": {
    "tokens": "style-dictionary build --config ./tokens.js"
  },
```

Run the scripts

```

npm run tokens

```

#### Token Formats

**Utility Token Structure**

Utility tokens allow you to generate SASS Maps for utility classes.
Structure **_Group/Rule/Item/Subitems/_** method or in a case where you don't need a group structure **_Rule/Item/Subitems_** when creating tokens for utilities classes:

- Group: SASS group
- Rule: Targets the CSS rule size for e.g: `size: 1rem`
- Items/Subitems: are used for the class names `.prefix-item-subitem: 0.75rem` e.g: `.mx-fs-xs: 0.75rem`

```json
{
  "GROUP": {
    "RULE": {
      "ITEM": {
        "KEY": "VALUE",
        "COMMENT": "COMMENT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Font-Size Utility Tokens** (example)

```json
// fonts.json
{
  "font": {
    "size": {
      "fs": {
        "sm": {
          "value": "0.875rem",
          "comment": "descriptions..."
        },
        "md": {
          "value": "1.3rem",
          "comment": "descriptions..."
        },
        "lg": {
          "value": "1.5rem",
          "comment": "descriptions..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Color Utility Tokens** (examples)

```json
{
  "color": {
    "black": {
      "value": "#000000"
    },
    "white": {
      "value": "#ffffff"
    },
    "gray": {
      "value": "#6a737d"
    },
    "red": {
      "value": "#d73a49"
    }
  }
}
```

**Component Token Structure** (example)

Component tokens are structured a lot like how you write rules for a CSS button/card and will generate all the SASS/CSS for your element.
Structure **_Group/Name/Rules/Nesting/Rules_**:

- Group: Component SASS group
- Name: Component name
- Rules: Rules that style the Component e.g: `size: 1rem`
- Nested/Rules: Components can have nested rules

```json
{
  "GROUP": {
    "NAME": {
      "RULE": {
        "KEY": "VALUE",
        "COMMENT": "COMMENT"
      },
      "NESTED": {
        "RULE": {
          "KEY": "VALUE",
          "COMMENT": "COMMENT"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json

{
 "component": {
     "navbar": {
       "display": {
         "value": "flex"
       },
       "align-items": {
         "value": "center"
       },
       "height": {
         "value": "60px"
       }
     }
 }

```
